# Overview
This project involves developing a Battleship game application with an interactive graphical interface using the Swing framework for Java. The goal is to create a game where two players compete by strategically placing their ships on a grid and attempting to sink the opponent's fleet.

The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to separate the game logic, user interface, and control of interactions. Swing is used to build the graphical interface, providing an intuitive user experience with features like displaying the game grid, tracking moves, and updating each player's status in real time.
